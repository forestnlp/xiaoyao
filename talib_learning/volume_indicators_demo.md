# volume_indicators_demo.py

This script demonstrates how to calculate common volume-based technical indicators using the TA-Lib library. It fetches historical stock data, including volume, from BaoStock and then computes On-Balance Volume (OBV), Accumulation/Distribution Line (AD), and Money Flow Index (MFI). The script provides a practical example of integrating data acquisition with TA-Lib for volume analysis in quantitative trading.
